Here is a valid JSON object that can be used to call the calendar event creation API:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften",
    "description": "Neugier schläft nie! Die Universität Rostock und zahlreiche ...",
    "location": "Campus Südstadt,...",
    "start_time": "2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z",
    "end_time": "2025-05-16T00:00:00.000Z",
    "is_all_day": true,
    "repeat_frequency": null,
    "repeat_until": null
  }
]
```

Note that I assumed the event is an all-day event since the start and end dates are provided without specific times, and I set the times to midnight accordingly. I also left the recurrence options as null since there was no information provided about recurring events. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything!
